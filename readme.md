# ⛧ NNA - Node Name Abuse ⛧
#### Unity 2022+ Implementation
Extend any 3d format by abusing node-names to store data!\
This project is an abomination and the sooner it can burn in a fire, the better.\
⭐ Star this repo if you love heresy! ⭐

#### Early in development version, do not use productively!
**Install it using the VRChat Creator Companion: <https://squirrelbite.github.io/vpm/>**\
Alternatively clone this repository into a Unity project's `Assets` folder.\
*I will deal with UPM whenever UPM starts dealing with Git dependencies.*
