# ⛧ NNA - Node Name Abuse ⛧
#### Unity 2022+ Implementation
**Extend any 3d format by abusing node-names to store data!**

It works by serializing data into node-names in the scene hierarchy.\
This is about as heretical as it sounds, but it works, very well.

#### Early in development version, do not use productively!
**Install it using the VRChat Creator Companion: <https://squirrelbite.github.io/vpm/>**\
You can also install it using UPM by selecting 'Add Package from git URL'.\
Alternatively clone this repository into a Unity project's `Assets` folder.

I am disgusted by myself for making this.

Cheers!
